      <p>Hi, I'm Michele Filippig, the main author behind 96 Research.</p>

      <p>For almost a decade, I've managed a concentrated equity portfolio grounded in fundamental analysis. I focus primarily on small-mid caps positioned to benefit from market trends which fly under the radar for the average retail investor. Over time, this segment has proven to be a compelling sweet spot: While institutional money quickly capitalize on any trends, small-mid caps frequently fall outside the scope of sell-side research coverage and passive/quant-driven flows. This creates opportunities to identify genuinely undervalued businesses that can be confidently held for 12–24 months.</p>

      <p>I bring over five years of sell-side equity research experience to this work: three years at Jefferies covering pan-European industrials, and more than two years leading the equity research team at KT&Partners, a Milan-based boutique specializing in Italian listed SMEs. I'm also a regular contributor to The Street Sheet.</p>

      <p>Academically, I hold a BSc in Economics and Finance from Bocconi University and an MSc in Financial Engineering from EDHEC Business School. I've also passed CFA Level I.</p>

      <p>I hope you enjoy this space.</p>
