# Trading the Tide

<div id="gsl-return"></div>

There are nearly [7,000 container ships](https://www.progressivepolicy.org/trade-fact-of-the-week-a-new-container-ship-launches-every-day/) alone in the global merchant fleet, which totals more than 100,000 vessels. The world's largest class of cargo carriers each measure the length of four American football fields, and the width of nine school buses parked side by side.

Here are just a few of the hurricane-strength headwinds these tankers are facing: (i) The US has reimposed broad tariffs on key sectors; (ii) Europe is building new protectionist walls, (iii) Sanctions on Russia have reshaped entire trade corridors; (iv) The Red Sea has turned increasingly turbulent with geopolitical uncertainty.

Fortunately for investors, however, global trade is not a single ship. Again, the maritime ecosystem relies on thousands upon thousands of watercraft and companies working in tandem, none created equal.

Global seaborne trade grew just over 2% last year, per Carson Research. But demand, measured in ton-miles, or cargo volume multiplied by distance, the true measure of shipping work, [jumped more than 6%](https://insights.clarksons.net/2024-shipping-market-review/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

That's the sharpest rise in 15 years. Looking ahead, ton-mile demand is expected to [expand by around 6% in 2025](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/un-trade-reset-geopolitics-to-hurt-container-trade-growth), as Red Sea diversions lengthen voyages and global supply chains adjust to the new routing patterns.

Suez Canal transits [remain down 50% from peak levels](https://maritime-executive.com/article/red-sea-and-suez-canal-traffic-increases-but-carriers-still-avoid-transits), with less than half the ships passing through today, compared to the pre-crisis average.

And [roughly one-third of Asia–Europe traffic has been rerouted around the Cape of Good Hope](https://media-publications.bcg.com/Whats-Next-for-Container-Shipping-in-the-Red-Sea-Crisis.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com), adding thousands of nautical miles to every voyage. In other words, ships are traveling farther, burning more fuel, and spending longer at sea. They're trying to sail around the storm.

What's fascinating is that, even as spot container rates have cooled from their 2022 peaks, underlying demand continues to climb. Analysts expect it to stay structurally high as long as geopolitical tension and regional disruptions persist. Every diversion adds time, cost, and complexity, but also opportunity. While spot container rates have softened, inefficiency itself has become a profit source for operators who can adapt quickly to shifting lanes and secondary ports.

Which brings us back to our metaphor. Who benefits from this shift? Likely not the mega-carriers with ultra-large ships tied to fixed mainline routes. Instead, it may well be the operators with flexible fleets who can swiftly adjust to emerging lanes and smaller ports.

Inefficiency is not a rising tide that lifts all boats; it's a sorting mechanism.

According to our analyses, one company in particular appears poised to capture rerouted cargo flows, exploit secondary terminals, and potentially secure premium returns in volatile conditions.

Let's dig in.
